Notes to self while mothballing the tracker for a while (1/30/2020)

Performance is OK, but metric still not up to teh level it was on Jan 21, which was an intermediary state. 
The tracking, in this new architecture probably need more work... 

I got some comfort when comparing these two versions for detection only. The newer version works better, so it must just be a matter of 
improving the tracking portion (track_humans)

When there is ambiguity, e.g. two persons matching another set of two persons, but not certainty as to who is who, then neither is included. 
Probably, there should be a concept of temporary tracking representation for these...

Also, the color feature doesn't seem to help as much as it ought to.
